<Accordion title="Why Are Medical Exams Necessary for CDL Holders?"> CDL holders are responsible for operating heavy vehicles, sometimes over long distances and for extended periods, which can be taxing on the body. Medical exams ensure that drivers:
Have the physical ability to handle the demands of driving commercial vehicles.
Can maintain a level of alertness necessary to react to driving conditions and hazards.
Do not have medical conditions that could lead to emergencies while operating a commercial vehicle.
