Maintaining your Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) involves more than just driving skills; it requires regular medical examinations to ensure that you are physically and mentally fit to operate a commercial vehicle safely.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why Are Medical Exams Necessary for CDL Holders?">
    CDL holders are responsible for operating heavy vehicles, sometimes over long distances and for extended periods, which can be taxing on the body. Medical exams ensure that drivers:
    - Have the physical ability to handle the demands of driving commercial vehicles.
    - Can maintain a level of alertness necessary to react to driving conditions and hazards.
    - Do not have medical conditions that could lead to emergencies while operating a commercial vehicle.

  <Accordion title="What is the DOT Medical Exam?">
    The Department of Transportation (DOT) medical exam is designed to ensure that a person is medically qualified to safely operate a commercial vehicle. A DOT certified medical examiner conducts the exam, which includes:
    - Review of your health history.
    - Vision and hearing tests.
    - Blood pressure and pulse rate.
    - Urinalysis.
    - Physical examination.
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="How Often Must CDL Drivers Get a Medical Exam?">
    Typically, you must undergo the DOT medical exam every 24 months. However, if you have certain conditions like high blood pressure, you may need to get the exam more frequently.
    Remember: Failure to maintain a current medical certificate can result in the suspension of your CDL.
