A commercial driver's license (CDL) is a driver's license required to operate large, heavy, or placarded hazardous material vehicles in the United States in commerce. **There are several different types of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) that require a driver to hold a valid commercial driver's license.**

Employers actively look for CDL drivers with one of these license classes, so we recommend you get the one you need before applying for your dream job. To drive certain specialized types of vehicles such as buses or tank trucks or carry hazardous materials, you must also **apply for the proper endorsements on your CDL**. Some of the [endorsements](endorsements/introduction) include [Passenger (P)](endorsements/passenger), allowing you to carry passengers; [Tank (T)](endorsements/tanker), allowing you to drive trucks containing liquid cargo; and [H (Hazardous Materials)](endorsements/hazmat), allowing you to drive trucks containing such hazardous materials as flammable liquids, explosives, or radioactive substances. To obtain an endorsement, you will need to pass a specialized knowledge exam and possibly a specialized driving skills test. 

To obtain an H, P, or School Bus (S) endorsement, you must successfully complete training from FMCSA-approved training providers. To obtain an S endorsement, you must also undergo a thorough background check.

## What is a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)?

A Commercial Driver's License is required to drive commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) such as tractor-trailers, semi-trucks, dump trucks, and passenger buses. If you long for a career on the road rather than in an office, you’ll most likely need a [CDL](https://driving-tests.org/cdl-practice-test/). There are three classes of CDLs that determine the kinds of vehicles you’re permitted to drive: Class A, Class B, and Class C. CDL classification is also determined by the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and other specific requirements.

It takes highly specialized knowledge and skills to operate a commercial motor vehicle. But prior to 1986, many states allowed anyone with an automobile driver license to operate a CMV. As a result, many drivers throughout the country were driving CMVs without proper training. On October 27, 1986, the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act was signed into law. This law made it mandatory for all drivers of commercial vehicles to have a CDL. By ensuring that bus drivers and operators of large trucks are highly trained and qualified, this law has improved highway safety significantly. A further upgrade of driver training standards took place on February 7, 2022. Effective that date, applicants seeking to obtain a Class A or Class B CDL or an H, P, or S endorsement must successfully complete training from FMCSA-approved training providers listed in the FMCSA Training Provider Registry (TPR).

## What is a Commercial Learner’s Permit (CLP)?

A commercial learner’s permit (CLP) is a permit given by your state that authorizes you to practice driving a commercial motor vehicle. Obtaining a CLP is the first step towards earning a commercial driver’s license.

## [How to Get a CDL](/how-to-get-a-cdl-license/)

The minimum age to apply for a CDL is typically 21. However, some states allow drivers between the ages of 18 and 20 to apply for a single-state CDL. A single-state CDL allows the driver to only operate a commercial vehicle within the driver’s state of residence (_intrastate_ driving). When the driver turns 21, that restriction is automatically removed.

You can apply for a CDL at a [local DMV office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/). There are strict federal guidelines for obtaining a CDL, and each state has its own requirements that need to be also met. You must pass both a written knowledge exam and a driving skills test, which are designed by your state.
