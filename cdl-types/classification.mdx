A commercial driver's license (CDL) is a driver's license required to operate large, heavy, or placarded hazardous material vehicles in the United States in commerce. There are several different types of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) that require a driver to hold a valid commercial driver's license.

Employers actively look for CDL drivers with one of these license classes, so we recommend you get the one you need before applying for your dream job. To drive certain specialized types of vehicles such as buses or tank trucks or carry hazardous materials, you must also **apply for the proper endorsements on your CDL**. Some of the [endorsements](endorsements/introduction) include [Passenger (P)](endorsements/passenger), allowing you to carry passengers; [Tank (T)](endorsements/tanker), allowing you to drive trucks containing liquid cargo; and [H (Hazardous Materials)](endorsements/hazmat), allowing you to drive trucks containing such hazardous materials as flammable liquids, explosives, or radioactive substances. To obtain an endorsement, you will need to pass a specialized knowledge exam and possibly a specialized driving skills test. 

To obtain an H, P, or School Bus (S) endorsement, you must successfully complete training from FMCSA-approved training providers. To obtain an S endorsement, you must also undergo a thorough background check.
