One option for obtaining a CDL is to attend a CDL training school.

## 2. Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) Certification Costs 
Introduced in February 2022, the federal ELDT certification requirement aims to standardize the training process for entry-level drivers seeking to obtain a CDL license. This requirement applies to new drivers seeking a Class A or Class B CDL, or an endorsement for hazardous materials, passenger transport, or school bus operation. The cost of ELDT certification will depend on the type of training program you choose, as well as the state you’re in.

Depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to drive, you may also need to obtain additional endorsements on your CDL. For example, if you plan to drive a tanker truck, you’ll need to obtain a tanker endorsement. Endorsement fees can vary depending on the type of endorsement you need, but generally, you can expect to pay **between 5 and 50 dollars per endorsement**. 

## 5. Medical Exam Costs 
Another cost to consider when obtaining your CDL is the cost of a medical exam.
