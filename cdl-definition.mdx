“CDL” stands for Commercial Driver’s License. A **commercial driver's license (CDL)** is a driver's license required to operate large, heavy, or placarded hazardous material vehicles for commercial purposes in the United States. 

Several types of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) require a driver to hold a valid CDL. The driver may also be required to obtain one or more special [endorsements](cdl-types/endorsements/introduction), such as [Air Brakes](cdl-types/endorsements/air-brakes), [Hazardous Materials (Hazmat)](cdl-types/endorsements/hazmat), [Tankers(cdl-types/endorsements/tanker), or Passenger Vehicles, to drive a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a truck with a tank, a truck carrying hazardous materials, or a passenger vehicle respectively. 

Each type of CDL and endorsement requires that you pass a written test; some also require a skills test. Some types of endorsements have additional requirements. For Hazmat, the driver must also be fingerprinted and undergo a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security threat assessment.

## What is a Commercial Learner's Permit (also known as a CLP or a CDL permit)? ##
In short, a CLP is the first step in getting your CDL. You need a CLP to practice driving a commercial motor vehicle (CMV). An applicant receives a Commercial Learner's Permit after they pass the required knowledge tests for the CMV class and the endorsements he or she wishes to obtain. 

The CLP authorizes the holder to operate a CMV in the same class and with the same endorsements as the CDL, but only when accompanied by the holder of a valid commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsements for the vehicle being operated. The CLP holder must practice driving with a licensed driver with the proper endorsements for at least 14 days before taking the skills test.
