“CDL” stands for Commercial Driver’s License. A **commercial driver's license (CDL)** is a driver's license required to operate large, heavy, or placarded hazardous material vehicles for commercial purposes in the United States. 

Several types of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) require a driver to hold a valid CDL. The driver may also be required to obtain one or more special [endorsements](cdl-types/endorsements/introduction), such as [Air Brakes](cdl-types/endorsements/air-brakes), [Hazardous Materials (Hazmat)](cdl-types/endorsements/hazmat), [Tankers](cdl-types/endorsements/tanker), [School Bus](cdl-types/endorsements/school-bus), or [Passenger Vehicles](cdl-types/endorsements/passenger), to drive a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a truck with a tank, a truck carrying hazardous materials, a school bus, or a passenger vehicle respectively. Each type of CDL and endorsement requires that you pass a written test; some also require a skills test. Some types of endorsements have additional requirements. For Hazmat, the driver must also be fingerprinted and undergo a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security threat assessment.
